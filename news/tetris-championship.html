                    <p>The blocks are falling once again! We are excited to announce a fresh restock of authentic Tetris cartridges for the original Game Boy. This legendary puzzle game defined portable gaming and remains one of the most addictive and beloved titles in gaming history.</p>

                    <h2>The Game That Changed Everything</h2>
                    <p>When Tetris launched alongside the Game Boy in 1989, it became the killer app that propelled Nintendo's handheld to worldwide success. The simple yet infinitely replayable gameplay of rotating and arranging falling blocks captivated millions of players and established puzzle games as a dominant force in the industry.</p>

                    <p>Tetris on Game Boy is not just a game, it is a cultural phenomenon. Its iconic music, addictive gameplay, and perfect portability made it the ideal companion for players everywhere. Whether you are waiting for a bus, relaxing at home, or challenging friends to beat your high score, Tetris delivers endless entertainment.</p>

                    <h2>Pristine Condition Cartridges</h2>
                    <p>Our newly restocked Tetris cartridges represent some of the finest examples we have ever offered. Each cartridge features:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Clean, vibrant labels with minimal wear</li>
                        <li>Fully functional game with no glitches or errors</li>
                        <li>Tested on authentic Game Boy hardware</li>
                        <li>Clean contacts for reliable connection</li>
                        <li>Original Nintendo quality and construction</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>No Save Battery Required</h2>
                    <p>Unlike many Game Boy titles, Tetris does not require a save battery to function. The game uses a password system to track your progress, meaning you will never lose your high scores to a dead battery. This makes Tetris cartridges some of the most reliable and low-maintenance games in your collection.</p>

                    <h2>A Piece of Gaming History</h2>
                    <p>Owning an original Tetris cartridge means owning a piece of video game history. This version of Tetris is considered by many to be the definitive portable version of the game. Its tight controls, smooth performance, and iconic presentation have never been surpassed.</p>

                    <p>The Game Boy version of Tetris sold over 35 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling video games of all time. It launched careers, inspired countless imitators, and proved that simple, elegant game design could captivate audiences across all demographics.</p>

                    <h2>Perfect for Collectors and Players</h2>
                    <p>Whether you are a serious collector building a complete Game Boy library or a casual player looking to experience this legendary title, our Tetris cartridges offer exceptional value. The timeless gameplay ensures you will return to this game again and again, making it one of the best investments in your retro gaming collection.</p>

                    <h2>Multiple Copies Available</h2>
